Our number 1 feature to me is the fact that it will let you know when you are starting to run low on medication that way you don't for get to go the doctor/pharmacy to refill and pick up -Tyler

The only future goal I can think of at this time would be having the user add a custom sound as the notifications for when it is time to take there medication -Tyler
